# nodejs sqlite project

* Purpose of this is to bulk import assignments into a istd istudiez backup and then restore with new assignments.
* This project will do so using a .csv file. INITIAL part done see ISSUES below.
* It may also have support scraping different faculty websites to pull assignment data into a csv file automatically PENDING

## technologies used

* nodejs > v8

## reverse engineer db

* `sequelize-auto -h localhost -d ../ruby/main.db -e sqlite -c ./config/config.json -o "./schema/"`

## GETTING STARTED

* `cd` into this directory
* `npm install`
* If using an earlier version of nodejs before 8 use nvm to change
  * `nvm install 8`
  * `nvm use 8` version installed
* Copy config files
  * `cp config.template.json config.json`
  * `cp mainconfig.template.js mainconfig.js`
* Copy template from templates/ to input/ and fill in new assignments. Scraper may autogenerate this when done. E.g. `cp template/assignments_template.csv input/assignments_template.csv` Type in new assignemnt
* Backup from istudiez a new db file to `input/` folder and change file name in `config/mainconfig.js` **inputFile** to match input.
* Run project `node index.js` or `npm start`

## Issues

* Haven't figured out the datestamp calculation for assignments. From what I can tell the days are a count of days from the start date of the project and the timestamps represent something else. E.g.
  * Time does appear to be a reprensative of minutes in military time. So just divide notification_time by 60 to get minutes.
  * due_date seems to be a count of days from `1/1/70`
